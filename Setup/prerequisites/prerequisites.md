# Prerequisites

Before you begin programming, there are a few tasks that need to be completed to ensure your hardware is ready.


## Hardware Setup

Assuming you are using a REV Control Hub, [REV has graciously provided a guide on configuring it](https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-hub-gs). It is recommended to read through "Next Steps" as we will be going into more detail about some of the things that are mentioned.

[FIRST has also provided a guide for making a configuration file for your robot, as well as physically connecting hardware.](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/connecting_devices/index.html) Please note that FIRST's choice of hardware in this tutorial does not necessarily reflect best practices and modern preferences for certain devices, and that due diligence should be done in choosing devices.

## Software Setup

Before proceeding with this guide, please make sure you have done the following:
- [Have the latest version of Android Studio downloaded and installed.](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Have a repository containing the latest version of the FTC SDK.](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) I would recommend forking this on Github first and then cloning the fork locally.
- Make sure the Kotlin Plugin is downloaded in Android Studio.
