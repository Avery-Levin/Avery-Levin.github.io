## Guides

Assuming you are using a REV Control Hub, [REV has graciously provided a guide on configuring it](https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-hub-gs). It is recommended to read through "Next Steps" as we will be going into more detail about some of the things that are mentioned.

[FIRST has also provided a guide for making a configuration file for your robot, as well as physically connecting hardware.](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/connecting_devices/index.html) Please note that FIRST's choice of hardware in this tutorial does not necessarily reflect best practices and modern preferences for certain devices, and that due diligence should be done in choosing devices.
