[[{"i":"welcome","l":"Welcome!","p":["Welcome to the comprehensive guide to using Kotlin in your FTC codebase! This guide assumes that you know how to program in Kotlin, but no other FTC programming knowledge is necessary. This guide is meant for absolute beginners who do not have any experience with programming for FTC. If you already know how to do FTC programming in Java, or can easily translate Java to Kotlin, I would recommend doing that because more resources are written in Java,"]},{"l":"Contributing","p":["To contribute, all you have to do is make a pull request with the changes you would like to make. This is greatly appreciated as this is currently a solo, volunteer project."]},{"l":"Running locally","p":["To run this website locally, first install Retype. This can be accomplished by doing the following:","After navigating to the directory where you cloned the repository, run the following command to open the website in your web browser:"]}],[{"l":"Prerequisites","p":["Before you begin programming, there are a few tasks that need to be completed to ensure your hardware is ready."]},{"l":"Hardware Setup","p":["Assuming you are using a REV Control Hub, REV has graciously provided a guide on configuring it. It is recommended to read through \"Next Steps\" as we will be going into more detail about some of the things that are mentioned.","FIRST has also provided a guide for making a configuration file for your robot, as well as physically connecting hardware. Please note that FIRST's choice of hardware in this tutorial does not necessarily reflect best practices and modern preferences for certain devices, and that due diligence should be done in choosing devices."]},{"l":"Software Setup","p":["Before proceeding with this guide, please make sure you have done the following:","Have the latest version of Android Studio downloaded and installed.","Have a repository containing the latest version of the FTC SDK. I would recommend forking this on Github first and then cloning the fork locally.","Make sure the Kotlin Plugin is downloaded in Android Studio."]}],[{"l":"Installation","p":["Installing Kotlin into your FTC project is very easy and shouldn't take more than a few minutes."]},{"l":"Project Gradle Script","p":["The first step of adding Kotlin to your FTC project is by adding Kotlin to the build.gradle file that has Project: REPO-NAME next to it.

It then returns an object for the device you inputted and allows for you to control it in code."]}]]
