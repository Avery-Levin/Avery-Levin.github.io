# Welcome!
Welcome to the beginner's guide to using Kotlin in your FTC codebase!

## Whom is this guide for?
This guide assumes **no prior programming knowledge** other than basic Kotlin, but no other FTC programming knowledge is necessary. This guide is meant for **absolute beginners** and serves to act as a **foundation** for your FTC programming journey.

## Why Kotlin?
Kotlin offers **numerous benefits** over other FTC programming options.

First, Kotlin and Android Studio are **far more powerful** tools than Blocks or OnBotJava, allowing you to use **advanced** programming techniques. They are less limited by **UI**, and they allow you to use advanced libraries such as **RoadRunner** or **Pedro Pathing**.

Secondly, Kotlin is a syntactically **simpler** language than Java and offers many **quality of life** features that make programming easier, such as type inferencing. [The developers behind Kotlin offer numerous reasons why, and I suggest that you read them.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/comparison-to-java.html#some-java-issues-addressed-in-kotlin)

## Why K4FTC

I started this guide because I saw **no viable options** for **rookies** who are seeking to learn Kotlin for FTC without any previous knowledge of Java. While older, more experienced programmers who know both languages may be able to translate between the two languages when reading programming guides, this skill isn't obvious to younger rookies who haven't programmed before.

K4FTC seeks to bridge this **knowledge gap**. By providing **introductory** instruction in FTC programming in Kotlin, we can give rookie programmers the skills they need to **move on** to other programming guides and concepts.
