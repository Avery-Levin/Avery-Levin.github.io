# Welcome!
Welcome to the comprehensive guide to using Kotlin in your FTC codebase! This guide assumes that you know how to program in Kotlin, but no other FTC programming knowledge is necessary. This guide is for both absolute beginners and seasoned programmers, although if you are capable of translating Java into Kotlin, I would recommend that over this guide as there are more resources available for Java.
