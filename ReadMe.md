# Welcome!
Welcome to the comprehensive guide to using Kotlin in your FTC codebase! This guide assumes that you know how to program in Kotlin, but no other FTC programming knowledge is necessary. This guide is meant for absolute beginners who do not have any experience with programming for FTC. If you already know how to do FTC programming in Java, or can easily translate Java to Kotlin, I would recommend doing that because more resources are written in Java,
